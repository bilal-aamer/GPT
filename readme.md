The app features state-of-the-art NLP models like DALL-E, ChatGPT, and more, allowing users to experience and interact with these cutting-edge technologies in a user-friendly way.

## Features
- DALL-E: This model can create images from textual descriptions, allowing users to generate images based on what they type. Users can enter a phrase or sentence and watch as DALL-E generates an image based on their input.

- ChatGPT: This conversational AI model can chat with users, providing answers to their questions or engaging in casual conversation. Users can chat with the app in a natural, conversational manner and receive intelligent responses from the model.

More models to come: The app is designed to be expandable, and new NLP models will be added as they become available.
